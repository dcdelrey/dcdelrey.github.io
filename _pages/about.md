1. Masters student Anita Gjesteland from Pro. Magnus Svard's group at the University of Bergen will be visiting our group in May 
1. The paper "Provably Stable Flux Reconstruction High-Order Methods on Curvilinear Elements" has been accepted in the Journal of Computational Physics (you can see a preprint here<!--- [here](./files/blah.pdf)--->)

Research Overview
===============================================================================
The research focus in the Numerical PDEs Lab is on developing efficient and 
robust numerical algorithms for the solution of partial differential equations 
based on novel numerical methods with provable properties. We are broadly 
interested in numerical methods. For example, there are projects on 
finite-element methods (e.g., continuous and discontinuous Galerkin methods, 
flux reconstruction methods etc.), finite-difference methods, and finite-volume 
methods. We are also working on approaches to dealing with complex geometry 
e.g., unstructured non-tensor-product elements (including space-time elements) 
and overset approaches. Example areas of ongoing research include: 

1. Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian discretizations using space-time elements in d+1 
dimensions 
1. h/p/r adaptive mesh refinement
1. Linearly and nonlinearly stable discretizations

For efficient computation, for example on high-performance computing hardware, we 
develop technologies that accelerate computations while maintaining the provable 
properties of the base discretization. PDEs and physical applications of interest 
are broad and constantly growing; current areas are as follows: 

1. Compressible Euler and Navier Stokes equations: Various applications in Aerospace 
Engineering  
1. Mulitphase flows and linear/nonlinear wave equations: high intensity focused 
ultrasound 
1. Reaction diffusion and reaction convection diffusion equations: epidemic modeling

Prospective Students
======

The Numerical PDEs Group has a variety of projects ranging from the abstract development of numerical methods to their practical application and 
strong students with a range of skills are encouraged to apply. We specifically encourage, women and under represented students to apply to the group 
and will consider non-standard indicators of merit. Interested students please send an email outlining potential research areas of interest
 to Prof. David Del Rey Fernandez with a CV, transcript, and any relevant indicators of merit.
