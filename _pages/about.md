Research Overview
======
The research focuse in the Numerical PDEs Lab is on developing efficient and robust numerical algorithms for the solution of 
partial differential equations based on novel numerical methods with provable properties. We are broadly interested in numerical methods ranging from 
finite-element methods (e.g., continuous and discontinuous Galerkin methods, flux reconstruction methods etc.), finite-difference methods, and finite-volume methods. 
Example areas of ongoing research include: 

1. Multi-d elements for space-time/Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian discretizations 
1. h/p/r adaptive mesh refinment
1. 

For efficient computation, for example on high-performance computing hardware, we develop technologies that accelerate computations while maintaining 
the provable properties of the base discretization. PDEs and physical applications of interest are broad and constantly growing; current areas are as follows: 

1. Compressible Euler and Navier Stokes equations: Various applications in Aerospace Enginering  
1. Mulitphase flows and linear/nonlinear wave equations: high intensity focused ultrasound 
1. Reaction diffusion and reaction convection diffusion equations: epidemic modeling
